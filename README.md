# Slicer Morph
This is the development repository for our NSF ABI grant

SlicerMorph enable biologists to retrieve, visualize, measure and annotate high-resolution specimen data both from volumetric scans (CTs and MRs) as well as from 3D surface scanners effectively within 3D-Slicer. It also provides a Generalized Procrustes Analysis (GPA) module as well as tools to visualize PCA decomposition of the GPA results.
