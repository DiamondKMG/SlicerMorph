1. There is redunent code to be eleimnate in nearly all modules.  Should take a few days and restucture them at some point.

2. EDMA module draws all the signicant LM pairs.  May want to limit number drawn

3. For Export images, update button styling.  Also need to readress cropping, as it depends on display size. 

4. Update look of BMP toolbox.

5. For BPM toolbox, improve path to dropbox.  fails on computers without correct enviromental variable. 

Large improvemtns to be made.

	2. Consolidate and import import functions into a robust libary and update modules.
	3. Write a slicer node module for editing and updating nodes.
	4. Write a GUI library, with functions for the standard folder and file selectors, along with sliders, and displays.
